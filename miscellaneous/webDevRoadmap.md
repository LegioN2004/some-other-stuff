# Introduction

Welcome, everyone, to our journey into the dynamic world of web development!. At its core, web development is the intricate process of crafting and maintaining websites, transforming ideas into interactive online experiences. There are two main facets to this craft – the frontend, where the visual and interactive elements come to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend, the behind-the-scenes powerhouse managing logic, data, and servers, often coded in languages like Node.js, Python,Java or PHP. Some developers, known as full-stack developers, seamlessly navigate both the frontend and backend. Our toolkit is rich with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, version control systems such as Git, and task runners like Grunt or Gulp, streamlining the development process. Emphasizing the importance of responsiveness, we ensure our creations adapt perfectly to various devices, making the user experience seamless and enjoyable. So, let's demystify the essentials of web development and embark on this exciting journey together!

## HTML

which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the backbone of the web. It is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. Think of it as the blueprint that defines the structure of a web page. HTML consists of a series of elements, which is a standardized way to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. In summary, HTML is the fundamental language for creating web content. As you continue your journey into web development, understanding HTML is the first step towards building your own websites.

## CSS:

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the artistic sidekick to HTML. While HTML structures the content of a webpage, CSS adds the style and visual appeal. Think of CSS as the tool that lets you paint the canvas of your website, defining how it looks and feels. CSS is all about making your website visually appealing and user-friendly. It allows you to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, giving your web pages a unique and polished appearance. CSS is typically linked to an HTML document. You create a separate CSS file or include styles directly within your HTML file. HTML elements are then selected, and styles are applied to them using CSS rules. As you continue your journey in web development, mastering CSS will empower you to create stunning and responsive web design

### Checkpoint: frontend Development

Congratulations! You've successfully learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. You've laid the foundation for creating visually appealing and structured static websites. Now that you've gained a goood amount of learning HTML and CSS, you have the skills to design and develop static websites and you should go ahead and make some websites so as to test out the knowledge in the real world. These websites, while 'static' in nature, can be incredibly powerful for showcasing content, portfolios, or personal projects. To take your skills to the next level and make your websites dynamic and interactive, it's time to introduce JavaScript. JavaScript is the programming language of the web, allowing you to add functionality, handle user interactions, and create a more engaging user experience. To continue your learning journey, I recommend exploring online platforms like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, or Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), as said above. These resources provide interactive tutorials and exercises to solidify your JavaScript skills. Remember, practice is key! Start small by incorporating JavaScript into your existing static websites. As you gain confidence, challenge yourself with small projects that align with your interests.

## JavaScript:

JavaScript is the dynamic programming language of the web, allowing you to make your websites interactive and responsive. Unlike HTML and CSS, which handle structure and style, JavaScript is the engine that powers the behavior of your web pages. JavaScript enables you to add functionality to your static web pages. It's the language that lets you create interactive elements, handle user inputs, and dynamically update content without requiring a page refresh. One of the unique features of JavaScript is its ability to run directly in your web browser. This makes it a 'client-side' scripting language, allowing you to manipulate the content and behavior of a webpage on the user's device. One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). This allows you to dynamically update and modify the content and structure of your web page without reloading it. To make development even more efficient, many developers use libraries and frameworks built on top of JavaScript. Examples include jQuery, React, and Vue.js, which provide pre-built functionalities and tools. As you dive into JavaScript, practice is crucial. Start with small projects, like interactive forms or simple games. Building projects is a fantastic way to reinforce what you've learned."

## introduction to npm (Node Package Manager)

**Slide 2: What is npm?**

- _Introduction:_
  - "npm, which stands for Node Package Manager, is a powerful tool used in the world of Node.js development. It's essentially a package manager that helps you manage and organize the various libraries and tools (packages) that you use in your Node.js projects."
    **Slide 3: The Role of npm in Node.js**
- _Package Management:_
  - "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. npm comes into play by simplifying the way you manage, install, and share the various pieces of code that make up your Node.js applications."
    **Slide 4: Key Features of npm**
- _Dependency Management:_
  - "One of the key features of npm is its ability to handle dependencies. When you create a Node.js project, you often rely on external libraries or modules. npm keeps track of these dependencies and ensures that the right versions are installed."
- _Version Control:_
  - "npm allows you to specify the versions of the packages your project depends on. This helps maintain consistency across different environments and ensures that your code works as expected."
    Conclusion
  - "In summary, npm is a fundamental tool for Node.js developers. It simplifies the process of managing packages, handling dependencies, and automating common tasks. As you continue your journey into Node.js development, mastering npm will be a key skill in building robust and efficient applications."

### Checkpoint: External package management

At this point, you should be able to install and use external packages using npm. You probably know about npmjs.com where you can search for packages and read their documentation. You should also be familiar with the package.json file and how to use it to manage your project dependencies.
You don’t need to get into the module bundlers and build tools just yet. Just make sure that you are able to use the dependencies installed in the node_modules folder using simple link and script tags in your HTML.

- Regarding projects, here are a few ideas that you can try:
  - Create a simple webpage that shows the current time of user. You can use use dayjs to get the current time and display it on the page. Here is the sample design for homepage.
  - Install the micromodal library. Create a button on the page clicking which should open a modal and let the user select a timezone from a dropdown. Once the user selects a timezone, the modal should close and the time on the page should be updated to show the time in the selected timezone. Here is the sample design for the modal.

### Checkpoint Collaborative work

Now that you have learnt git and GitHub you should be ready to work with others. You should now setup your GitHub profile and push all the projects that you have built so far to your GitHub profile. Here are some of my recommendations for your GitHub profile:

Keep the repository names lowercase and use hyphens to separate words e.g. todo-app instead of TodoApp or Todo-App.
Add a README.md file to each repository that you create. This file should contain a description of the project. Put some effort into the readme and make sure it clearly details what the project is about and how anyone can run it locally.
Add snapshots of your project to the readme file so that anyone can see what the project looks like without having to run it locally.
Add a LICENSE file to each repository that you create. This file should contain the license that you want to use for the project. You can use choosealicense.com to help you choose a license.
