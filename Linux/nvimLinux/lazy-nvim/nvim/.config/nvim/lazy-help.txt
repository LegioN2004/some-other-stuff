I can testify that this video has indeed helped me to do the move to lazy :)

I was on the same path as OP though, i faced a bunch of different errors of several kinds.

In the end what worked for me :

restructure my whole configuration, with this simple structure (as found in lazy docs) :

.config/nvim/init.lua ,

.config/nvim/lua/plugins/init.lua

and a lot of files : .config/nvim/lua/plugins/<group of related plugins or single plugin>.lua.

each plugin file is structured like this :

return {

    'github/plugin',
    lazy = false,
    config = function()

        -- previous configuration 

    end

}
or if the file groups related plugins (mason, lsp, mini,....)

To avoid problems, i put everything on lazy=false at start as you can see. Using file names on lua/plugins/ as a quick and dirty way to control the loading of plugins.

As soon as configuration is complete and running, it is more easy imho to work with events, keys, priority, etc...

https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim has been of great help too.
